Vulkan Demos
============
This is my first experiments with Vulkan graphics API. I'm using [LunarG SDK](http://lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk), [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) and [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org).

* [vk-sdl](https://github.com/gecko0307/vulkan-demos/tree/master/vk-sdl) - cube demo from LunarG SDK ported to SDL2. Currently supports only Windows, sorry (relies on GetWindowLong to get HINSTANCE).

Eventually more demos will be added.
